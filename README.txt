In Class Programming Assignment 1: Python Basics; Exercises 1-4


List of Source Files: 

-TotalPrice.py

-Celsius.py

-Quadratic.py

-Seconds.py


Code Limitations: All source files do not properly work with negative values (except for Quadratic.py). Quadratic.py does not work with negative determinants. This will be addressed in Assignment #2. 


Deviations from Assignment Specifications: Each program prints a description of the program at the beginning. The program puts a blank line between each text to increase readability.
